I developed a Product CRUD application using Spring MVC, handling both the front-end and back-end. The
front-end was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,Boostrap while the back-end involved implementing all
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to efficiently manage product data. The application follows
the MVC design pattern for a clean and maintainable code structure.
